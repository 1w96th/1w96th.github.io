As you may know, it is one of the precious few buildings in NYC designed by Carrère & Hastings, one of the great Beaux-Arts architectural firms in U.S. history, who designed the historic NY Public Library on 5th Avenue, the Frick Building, and the Met Opera interior, among others.\r\n\r\nAlthough the church is landmarked, the new owners and developers plan to make changes that will compromise the landmarked exterior, and there are a few public meetings that will discuss the changes at which we can voice opposition.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested and willing to help save one of our greatest neighborhood assets, please attend the following:\r\n\r\nCommunity Board 7’s Landmark Preservation Committee hearing at 250 West 87th Street tomorrow night, November 13, at 8:00PM\r\n\r\n### ALSO VERY IMPORTANT\r\n\r\nThe Landmarks Preservation Commission’s Public Hearing at 1 Centre Street, 9th Floor,(tentatively on December 9, 2014, with time TBD.)","google":"UA-56686206-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
